Food Delivery Website
This is a simple food delivery website project built using HTML and CSS.
The website which we have designed is used to provide the food delivery services to the users or customers.
We can include more features to the above program which makes the website or app more featured and we can also make multivendor food delivery websites.
This website satisfies the customers with their required food and they can even contact us if they face any problem but this also requires a database where we can store the data of the users securely.
